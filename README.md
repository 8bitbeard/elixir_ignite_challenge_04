## Elixir Ignite Challenge #04

This project was made to fulfill the third challenge on the Rocketseat Ignite Elixir course challenge.

The challenge was to improove the report generator from challenge 3, using parallelism.

This repo was forked from the one that contains the code for the challenge 3 (https://github.com/8bitbeard/elixir_ignite_challenge_03)

To run this code first you need to install all the dependencies with `mix deps.get`, then you can run the tests with `mix test`
